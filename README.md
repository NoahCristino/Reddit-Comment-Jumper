# Reddit-Comment-Jumper

Adds a button to reddit that jumps to top comments

# About

This script jumps to top comments on reddit posts, making it easier to skip around and navigate. This button is designed after the jump button in the reddit app. I've created this because I love being able to jump to top comments in the app, and there is no way to do this on the website.

# Installation

To install this script make sure you have [TamperMonkey]() if you have Chrome, or [GreaseMonkey]() if you have Firefox. Then, goto https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/386694-reddit-comment-jumper and click the green install button. Now you should have a jump button in the bottom right corner everytime you are looking through reddit comments.
